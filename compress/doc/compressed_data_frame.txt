On the input side, meta data that we need to know is
n1, the number of rows
m1, the number of columns
widths[m]

Data is just a concatenation of the columns

On the output side, the meta data that we need to know is
n2 (same as n1)
m2, the number of columns
qtypes[m2], where qtypes[i] can be one of F8, I4, I1 corresponding to 
XT_ARRAY_DOUBLE
XT_ARRAY_INT
XT_ARRAY_BOOL

source[m2], where 0 <= source[i] < m1 
mechanism[m2] is of type extractor_t
