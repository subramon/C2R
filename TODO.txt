====================================================
The contents of rincs/ has been copied from Rserve/src/*.h
Not sure that this is the best thing to have done
Also modified
  421 | extern int isByteSexOk();
  to
  421 | extern int isByteSexOk(void);
====================================================
In exec_str, I am able to get back booleans but not very well
Not quite sure how to interpret the server's response
I am able to get one boolean back correctly
Was able to solve the problem of exists("coeff") which was failing
Had to hack my way around it by doing
paste("B", exists("coeff"))
====================================================

exec_str needs to be able to return things other than str
otherwise following fails 

parseString("length(n_ind)")
buffer parsed, stat=1, parts=1
result type: 20, length: 1
R_tryEval(xp,R_GlobalEnv,&Rerror);
Calling R_tryEval for expression 1 [type=6] ...
Expression 1, error code: 0
expression(s) evaluated (Rerror=0).
Vector of 1 integers:
1834
